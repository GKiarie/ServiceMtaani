# [SERVICEMTAANI](/README.md)

The app is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to both clients and mechanics.

Clients are able to create an account and post job requests. The job requests will include the specifics of the work required, such as car service, part changes, or a description of the issue with the car.

Mechanics will be able to create an account, view job requests, and bid on the jobs they are interested in. Clients will be able to choose a mechanic based on a combination of factors such as cost and reputation. Once a client selects a mechanic, the two parties will communicate through the app to arrange for the mechanic to either go to the client's premises to carry out the job or for the client to deliver the car to the mechanic's premises.

Additionally, the app has an online platform for selling car parts
